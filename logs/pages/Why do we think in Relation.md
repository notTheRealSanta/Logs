- It is no doubt that our brains are wired to perceive things in contrast to other things. #[[Contrast Principle]]
- A traditional Jewish joke
	- > A man comes to the rabbi and complains about his life: "I have almost no money, my wife is a shrew, and we live in a small apartment with seven unruly kids. It's messy, it's noisy, it's smelly, and I don't want to live."The rabbi says, "Buy a goat.""What? I just told you there's hardly room for nine people, and it's messy as it is!""Look, you came for advice, so I'm giving you advice. Buy a goat and come back in a month."In a month the man comes back and he is even more depressed: "It's gotten worse! The filthy goat breaks everything, and it stinks and makes more noise than my wife and seven kids! What should I do?"The rabbi says, "Sell the goat."A few days later the man returns to the rabbi, beaming with happiness: "Life is wonderful! We enjoy every minute of it now that there's no goat - only the nine of us. The kids are well-behaved, the wife is agreeable - and we even have some money!"
