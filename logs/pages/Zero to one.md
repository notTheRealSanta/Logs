- ## Intro
	- EVERY MOMENT IN business happens only once.
	- humans are distinguished from other species by our ability to work miracles. We call these miracles technology.
	- Technology is miraculous because it allows us to do more with less, ratcheting up our fundamental capabilities to a higher level
	- by creating new technologies, we rewrite the plan of the world.
	- The paradox of teaching entrepreneurship is that such a formula necessarily cannot exist; because every innovation is new and unique, no authority can prescribe in concrete terms how to be innovative.
	- the single most powerful pattern I have noticed is that successful people find value in unexpected places, and they do this by thinking about business from [[First Principles]] instead of formulas.
- ## 1 THE CHALLENGE OF THE FUTURE
	- Brilliant thinking is rare, but courage is in even shorter supply than genius.
	- When we think about the future, we hope for a future of progress.
	- At the macro level, the single word for horizontal progress is globalization
	- The single word for vertical, 0 to 1 progress is technology.
	- Our ancestors lived in static, zero-sum societies where success meant seizing things from others.
	- They created new sources of wealth only rarely,
	- As a result, we have inherited a richer society than any previous generation would have been able to imagine.
	- New technology tends to come from new ventures—startups.
	- small groups of people bound together by a sense of mission have changed the world for the better.
	- In the most dysfunctional organizations, signaling that work is being done becomes a better strategy for career advancement than actually doing work (if this describes your company, you should quit now).
	- This book is about the questions you must ask and answer to succeed in the business of doing new things: what follows is not a manual or a record of knowledge but an exercise in thinking. Because that is what a startup has to do: question received ideas and rethink business from scratch.
- ## 2 PARTY LIKE IT’S 1999
	- OUR CONTRARIAN QUESTION—What important truth do very few people agree with you on?
	- “Madness is rare in individuals—but in groups, parties, nations, and ages it is the rule,” Nietzsche wrote (before he went mad).
	- guide business thinking today:
		- 1. Make incremental advances
			- Grand visions inflated the bubble, so they should not be indulged. Anyone who claims to be able to do something great is suspect, and anyone who wants to change the world should be more humble. Small, incremental steps are the only safe path forward.
		- 2. Stay lean and flexible All companies must be “lean,” which is code for “unplanned.” You should not know what your business will do; planning is arrogant and inflexible. Instead you should try things out, “iterate,” and treat entrepreneurship as agnostic experimentation.
		- 3. Improve on the competition Don’t try to create a new market prematurely. The only way to know you have a real business is to start with an already existing customer, so you should build your company by improving on recognizable products already offered by successful competitors.
		- 4. Focus on product, not sales If your product requires advertising or salespeople to sell it, it’s not good enough: technology is primarily about product development, not distribution. Bubble-era advertising was obviously wasteful, so the only sustainable growth is viral growth.
		- the opposite principles are probably more correct: 1. It is better to risk boldness than triviality. 2. A bad plan is better than no plan. 3. Competitive markets destroy profits. 4. Sales matters just as much as product.
	- The most contrarian thing of all is not to oppose the crowd but to think for yourself.
- ## 3 ALL HAPPY COMPANIES ARE DIFFERENT
	- what valuable company is nobody building?
	- your company could create a lot of value without becoming very valuable itself. Creating value is not enough—you also need to capture some of the value you create.
	- Americans mythologize competition and credit it with saving us from socialist bread lines.
	- Actually, [[Capitalism]] and [[Competition]] are opposites.
	- [[Capitalism]] is premised on the accumulation of capital, but under perfect competition all profits get competed away.
	- The lesson for entrepreneurs is clear: if you want to create and capture lasting value, don’t build an undifferentiated commodity business.
	- In business, money is either an important thing or it is everything.
	- Monopolists can afford to think about things other than making money; non-monopolists can’t.
	- In perfect competition, a business is so focused on today’s margins that it can’t possibly plan for a long-term future.
	- monopolies can keep innovating because profits enable them to make the long-term plans and to finance the ambitious research projects that firms locked in competition can’t dream of.
	- the long-run equilibrium predicted by 19th-century physics was a state in which all energy is evenly distributed and everything comes to rest—also known as the heat death of the universe. Whatever your views on thermodynamics, it’s a powerful metaphor: in business, equilibrium means stasis, and stasis means death.
	- Monopoly is the condition of every successful business.
	- Tolstoy opens Anna Karenina by observing: “All happy families are alike; each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.” Business is the opposite. All happy companies are different: each one earns a monopoly by solving a unique problem. All failed companies are the same: they failed to escape competition.
- ## 4 THE IDEOLOGY OF COMPETITION
	- CREATIVE MONOPOLY MEANS new products that benefit everybody and sustainable profits for the creator.
	- [[Competition]] means no profits for anybody, no meaningful differentiation, and a struggle for survival. So why do people believe that competition is healthy?
	- [[Competition]] is an ideology—the ideology—that pervades our society and distorts our thinking.
	- Our educational system both drives and reflects our obsession with [[Competition]]. #Education
	- Higher education is the place where people who had big plans in high school get stuck in fierce rivalries with equally smart peers over conventional careers like management consulting and investment banking. #Education
	- Amid all the human drama, people lose sight of what matters and focus on their rivals instead.
	- [[Competition]] can make people hallucinate opportunities where none exist.
	- If you can recognize competition as a destructive force instead of a sign of value, you’re already more sane than most.
