- All human beings alive today are born into a world that has been already entangled with the idea of [[money]]. To understand money, one need to understand the origins of the idea of money.
	- Before the wide spread usage of the current idea of money, the barter system was **not** the main mode of transactions.[*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_money#Prehistory:_predecessors_of_money_and_its_emergence) Barter did exist, but most transactions were between people, were sort of a mental *I owe you* (IOU). Most transactions happened between people of the same tribe.[*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gift_economy) The tribes were small in number, enough for everyone to keep track of [[debt]] in their mental ledger. More often than not these debts were forgiven and forgotten, so long as the person who is in debt did their share of work.
	- As tribes began to grow as a result of efficient processes in the early agrarian societies, a need for a universal ledger began to grow. This was initially solved with clay tablets recording what everyone owes to everyone else. But, soon these **IOU** began to have physical manifestation in forms of salt, shell, teeth and subsequently metals.
- It is important to note that the idea of money and the idea of [[debt]] originated at the same point in time.
	- more specifically, when IOUs are not instantly redeemed, debt is created.
