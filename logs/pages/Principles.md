- [[Understanding Others]] Beings
- You learn when you are wrong
- You are not the center of the universe.
- [[Happiness]] = [[Reality]] - [[Expectations]]
- Take only the necessary inspiration from others. What you are searching to become only lies within yourself.
- Listen more.
- Correlation does not mean causation.
- Neurons that fire together, wire together.
	- Habits you form become who you are.
- Meditate everyday. Meditation is art of controlling your attention.
	- When you control your attention it's like looking into your source code, the code that runs you.
	- Understanding everything else is a downstream from controlling attentions.
- What you don't know you don't know >>  what you know you don't know > what you know
	- It doesn't matter how much you know, what matters is what you can do with what you know.
- Don’t follow your Dreams
	- They are constrained by the present
	  What you know in the present
	  What present offers you
	  and not what they will be in the future.
	- Don’t create a map for your ‘life’
	  Use a compass.
